				About<br>
				Most people on planet earth believe that the earth is round. However, what if you began to doubt this thought. “Is it Flat” is a disection of a community that believe what we consider a fact to actually be a “coverup”. This site is meant to synthesise these beliefs to make it easy for people to understand.

				History<br>
				During humanity's first 4,000 years, many believed in flat earth theory. The ancient Egyptians, Mesopotamians, Islamic and Christian scholars all believed in flat earth theory. However, after
				Cappernicus presented the theory of a spherical earth in the 16th century, many people including religious entities began to embrace it. Today, a spherical earth is even considered the norm. However, flat earthers believe there are several holes in this theory. <br>For one, when Cappernicus discovered this in 1500, the Technology to prove his theory was non existent.
				The only vehicles for travel were sailboats; hot air balloons weren't invented until 1760, and airplanes in 1903. Another argument is once the "globe model" was introduced to the education system, challenges of the model faded. Flat earthers argue that most people believe the earth is a sphere because for generations due to it being taught in every classroom. Earthers argue people need to think for themselves, and open their mind to new truths.

				Space<br>
				One argument you may hear is that if the earth was flat, then astronauts would have told us by now. However, there are flat earthers who have theorized astronauts know about the flatness of the globe; however they are sworn to secrecy. Their proof of this is when astronauts go to space, there is never an exterior shot where the astronaut pans the camera 350 degrees, and shows all of earth. It's the same concept as breaking the fourth wall on television. Further reasoning behind these claims are
				pictures of earth from space have also
				been found to be artificial composite shots. When you search earth from space
				There are HD cameras everywhere, you can’t have take a picture of the earth because it's impossible to get into a high enough altitude to do so.
				<p>
				
				Commercial Air Traffic Routes Are Wrong<br>
				Distance between South America and Australia should be a
				atraight shot across the south pacific ocean. However, 
				these routes take unnecessarily wrong routes. These routes don't make sense on a spherical world; however it makes sense on the flat world model as they are the greatest distance between two points.

				<p>
				The Map<br>
				One of the misconceptions of flat earthers is that people in the community think the earth is completely flat. In actuallity, flat earthers believe that the earth exists as a dome, with a protective ozone on top. <p>
